# PrimeLabelGrid
My attempt to create an algorithm to create a graph grid with coprime labelings using the genetic algorithm.
example:<br>
6 5 3<br>
7 2 1<br>
4 9 8<br>

all adjacent numbers (vertically and horizontally) are coprime<br>
6 is coprime to 5 and 7<br>
5 is coprime to 6,3, and 2<br>
3 is coprime to 5 and 1<br>
7 is coprime to 6,2 and 4<br>
1 is coprime to 3,2 and 8<br>
4 is coprime to 7 and 9<br>
9 is coprime to 4,2 and 8<br>
8 is coprime to 1 and 9<br>

Based on Graph theory!<br>
First time making the genetic algorithm<br>
