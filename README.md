# PrimeLabelGrid
My attempt to create an algorithm to create a graph grid with coprime labelings using the genetic algorithm.
example:
6 5 3
7 2 1
4 9 8

all adjacent numbers (vertically and horizontally) are coprime
6 is coprime to 5 and 7
5 is coprime to 6,3, and 2
3 is coprime to 5 and 1
7 is coprime to 6,2 and 4
1 is coprime to 3,2 and 8
4 is coprime to 7 and 9
9 is coprime to 4,2 and 8
8 is coprime to 1 and 9

Based on Graph theory!
First time making the genitic algorithm
